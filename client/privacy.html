  <h3>Effective date: Nov 1, 2015</h3>
  <p>
    We at Ceek  ("Ceek" "we," "us," "our") know our users ("you," "your") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    By submitting Personal information through our Site or Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">What does this privacy policy cover?</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not intentionally collect or solicit personal information from visitors under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@ceek.cc.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">What information does Ceek collect?</h2>
  <p>
    We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website and Product, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties. We collect the following types of information:
  </p>
  <h4>A. Information You Provide To Us</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, location, phone number, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name, employment history, education history, personal summary, and password when you create an account to log in to our network (“Account”).
    </li>
    <li>
      We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users will be able to see it, along with your profile photo and any other information that you choose to make public on your public profile page (“Profile”). The information that you provide in your Profile will be visible to others, including anonymous visitors to the Site.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you post messages on the message boards of our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.
    </li>
    <li>
      We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Service.
    </li>
    <li>
      We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>B. Information You Provide To Facebook And Other Social Networking Sites</h4>
  <p>
    In the course of using the Services, you may provide information which may be used by Company in connection with the Services. You understand that by posting information or content on the Website, or otherwise providing content, materials or information to Company or in connection with the Services (collectively, "Company Submissions"), Company hereby is and shall be granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable and transferable right to fully exploit such Company Submissions (including all related intellectual property rights) in connection with the Website, the Services, and/or Company's (and/or its successors and assigns) business; however, Company will only share Company Submission in accordance with Section 6 below. For example, you may provide Company with your requested criteria for employment candidates and a description of your business, and Company may use this information to find potential employees for you and to provide information about your business to those potential employees. You understand that Company retains the right to reformat, modify, create derivative works of, excerpt, and translate any Company Submissions submitted by you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not currently registered as a user of the Service, and you click on “Sign In” using Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, Angellist, or another SNS that we support, you will first be asked to enter your SNS credentials and then be given the option to register for the Service. In this case, we may receive information from that SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site. Any information that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.
  </p>
  <h4>C. Information Collected Via Technology</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Site and Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Service to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Service again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Flash LSOs. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.
    </li>
    <li>
      Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Service. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>D. Information Collected From You About Others</h4>
  <p>
    If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names and e-mail addresses as required above. You or the third party may contact us at help@Ceek.com to request the removal of this information from our database. Also, when you invite friends to the Service, we will access your Address Book and we will import your contacts names and phone numbers in order to facilitate the invitation. The e-mail that is sent to your friends will come from your e-mail address so that your friends know that you want to invite them to visit the Site. We do not store any passwords you provide as part of the contact import process. We also collect some settings that help us to interpret your data, such as the language and keyboard settings that you have established.
  </p>
  <h4>E. Information Collected From Third Party Companies</h4>
  <p>
    We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies that provide our Service by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Service we provide.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">Will Ceek share any of the personal information it receives?</h2>
  <p>
    We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties only as described below.
  </p>
  <h4>A. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</h4>
  <p>
    In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Website profile or to automatically transmit information in your Website profile to your third party account.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow these automatic transmissions, please review all third party websites' policies.
  </p>
  <h4>B. Agents:</h4>
  <p>
    We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
  </p>
  <h4>C. User Submissions, User Profiles, and Interaction With Employers and Affiliates:</h4>
  <p>
    User profile information including, without limitation, your name, email address and other contact information, employment history and other employment details (including information that may have been automatically transmitted to your Website account from a third party site or service) (“User Profile Information”), may be displayed to Employers (as that term is defined in our Terms of Use http://www.Ceek.com/terms) in accordance with the preferences you have indicated and the functionality of the Website, in order to facilitate interaction between you and Employers. For example, an Employer will tell us what type of candidate it is looking for, and if your employment history matches the Employer's criteria, we will display an anonymized version of your resume and employment history and details to such Employer (i.e., without your name or contact information). If the Employer is interested in contacting you, we will ask you whether you want to be contacted by that Employer. If you do, we will give your contact information to the Employer, but we only authorize Employers to contact you for the purposes of discussing potential employment, and for no other reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may register with us through a landing page on our Website that is associated with one of our referral affiliates (an “Affiliate”). If you do so, your User Profile Information may also be displayed to the applicable Affiliate, in accordance with the preferences you have indicated and the functionality of the Services. For example, when you register through an Affiliate, you may be given the option to display your real name and other User Profile Information (which, in the case of Affiliates, may also include your history of employment placements made through our Services) to such Affiliate, so that they may communicate with you regarding our Services and keep track of the successes you’ve had through our Services.
  </p>
  <h4>D. Business Transfers:</h4>
  <p>
    We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
  </p>
  <h4>E. Protection of Ceek and Others:</h4>
  <p>
    We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ceek, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  </p>
  <h4>F. With Your Consent:</h4>
  <p>
    Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">Is personal information about me secure?</h2>
  <p>
    Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">What personal information can I access?</h2>
  <p>
    Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you've provided to us:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      name and password
    </li>
    <li>
      email address and contact information
    </li>
    <li>
      user profile information, including your education background, employment history, personal summary

  <p>
    The information you can view and update may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@Ceek.cc.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">What choices do I have?</h2>
  <p>
    You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained in Section 5. above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Please note that some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of your account with Ceek by emailing us at support@ceek.cc.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please email us at support@ceek.cc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website and the Product, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. Please also note that once Employers have your contact information, we are not able to control the manner or frequency in which they contact you; if you would like to stop receiving messages from Employers, please indicate your preference to those Employers directly.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here: https://ceek.cc/privacy.html and we will change the “Last Updated” date above. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Continued use of our Site or Service, following posting of such changes, shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms of such changes.
  </p>
  <h2 class="help-faq-section-title uppercase">Questions or concerns</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns or complaints about our Privacy Policy or our data collection or processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please email us at support@ceek.cc.
